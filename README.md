# Geophysical Inversion Techniques
This repository contains various MATLAB implementations related to geophysical inversion techniques that I developed, particularly focusing on apparent resistivity computations and electrical resistivity arrays. The key components of this repository include:  

- Ghosh Inverse Filter Coefficients  
- Guptasarma Inverse Filter Coefficients  
- Least-squares inversion of apparent resistivity  
- Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse  
- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)  
- Generalized Inverse  
- Electrical Resistivity Arrays including:  
  - Pole-Dipole  
  - Dipole-Dipole  
  - Wenner  
  - Pole- Pole
